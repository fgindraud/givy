std::thread::hardware_concurrency ()

Allocator:
- sizeclasses
	- better sizeclass sizes ?
- reduce superpage header
	- better pack page block headers for cache locality (struct of arrays ?)
- virtual mapping overhaul:
	- class that implements setup/map/destroy/cleanup
	- eager (current) version, setup/cleanup=null, map/destroy=mmap/munmap
	- lazy version, setup/cleanup=mmap/munmap gas, map=null, destroy=discard ?
- atomic get_containing_block ?
- optimize deallocation (Blk)
- refined SPB ownership:
	- active list in || with ownership list
	- central heap list ? (cache, orphaned blocks, ...)
- alloc parts:
	- useless... remove and just let the bootstrap allocator
- atomics:
	- SPT improvements ?
	- owner : release-acquire seems good
