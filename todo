std::thread::hardware_concurrency ()

Linkage / structure:
- never use multiple

Allocator:
- sizeclasses
	- better sizeclass sizes ?

- superpage header
	- head -> use index
	- better pack page block headers for cache locality (struct of arrays ?)
	- separate in spb_h and spb types
	- page block interval structure

- virtual mapping overhaul (low priority)
	- class that implements setup/map/destroy/cleanup
	- eager (current) version, setup/cleanup=null, map/destroy=mmap/munmap
	- lazy version, setup/cleanup=mmap/munmap gas, map=null, destroy=discard ?
	- beware of Bootstrap::Allocator

- atomic get_containing_block
	- relaxed ?

- optimize deallocation (Blk)

- refined SPB management:
	- central heap list ? (cache, orphaned blocks, ...)
	- active_spb by page block size list in TLH ? or global unused page block list ?

- atomics:
	- SPT improvements ?
	- owner : release-acquire seems good
