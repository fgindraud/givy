std::thread::hardware_concurrency ()

Allocator:
- TLH destruction and orphan SPB << 2
- sizeclasses
	- better sizeclass sizes ?
- reduce superpage header
	- better pack page block headers for cache locality (struct of arrays ?)
- optimize deallocation (local) << 3
- virtual mapping overhaul:
	- class that implements setup/map/destroy/cleanup
	- eager (current) version, setup/cleanup=null, map/destroy=mmap/munmap
	- lazy version, setup/cleanup=mmap/munmap gas, map=null, destroy=discard ?
- properly support deallocate inside block (atomic get_containing_block)
